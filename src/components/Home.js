				Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Michael Brock and I appreciate
				you taking the time to stop by. I have recently begun my journey into
				software development, and will use this site to reflect new skills and
				techniques that I pick up along the way! I have a passion for both web
				and game development, creativity, and if it isn't obvious (see image to
				the left), pizza! Feel free to poke around, and reach out with any
				questions, comments or suggestions.
